# Landmark-detection-for-mosquito-wings

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting wing landmarks across different mosquito species.
It aims to sytematically analyse wing morphology using geometric morphometrics and deep learning, with a focus on comparing different neural network architectures (CNN vs UNet) for landmark detection.

## Data
- **Wing images:** High-resolution images of mosquito wings from various species.
- **Normalized landmark coordinates:** Annotated landmarks corresponding to each wing image, used for training and evaluation.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies (Python 3.11 recommended):
